# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
cfn_nag or cfn-python-lint or Checkov tool can be used or integrated into code pipeline to check CF templates for security vulnerabilites. 

### Example vulnerability
IAM policies that are too permissive like S3 action statement that allows all operations and access to all buckets.  
Security group rules that allow 0.0.0.0/0 Cidr instead of /32 prefix or another security group.
Access logs that aren’t enabled
Encryption that isn’t enabled on EBS or S3 buckets.
