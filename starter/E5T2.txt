# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Security code analysis of CloudFormation template to provision AWS resources
You can use Stelligent’s cfn_nag tool to perform additional validation of your template resources for security. The cfn-nag tool looks for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure provisioning and validates against AWS best practices. For example:

IAM rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
Security group rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
Access logs that aren’t enabled
Encryption that isn’t enabled
Password literals
You provision a CodeBuild project for security code analysis as the second step in CodePipeline. This helps detect any insecure infrastructure provisioning issues.
