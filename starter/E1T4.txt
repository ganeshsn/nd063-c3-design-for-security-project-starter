Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

inbound rule of WebAppSG (Web Server instance) should allow only TCP 5000 from AppLoadBalancerSG (App load balancer) and restrict SSH access to specific /32 addresses.
Web Service Instance - C3 . Security group inbound rules need to be updated.

a) Allow only TCP 5000 traffic from App load balance
     - Update source of TCP 5000 to AppLoadBalancerSG
b) Remove HTTP 80 and All traffic rules from WebAppSG inbound rules
c) Remove all traffic rules from WebAppSG rules
d) Restrict SSH access - Specify IP address(s) instead of 0.0.0.0/0 as the source


# Poor practice 2

Place Web Server instance, target of ELB in a private subnet.
Apply NACL to allow inbound traffic from Public subnet. 
Specify s3 bucket name in InstanceRolePolicy-C3 policy instead of "Resource:*"
