# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

  -  Place the Web Service instance in a private subnet (i.e. no route to internet via igw) and use NACL to restrict access to the private subnet. 
  -  Update Web Server SG - Remove ingress rule that allows SSH access from any where.  Either use SSM to connect to the Web Server or allow SSH connectivity from a bastion host.
  -  Update SSH config to remove password authentication on WS instance 

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

   - Create a VPC Gateway endpoint for S3 - specify endpoint policy to allow only priviledged users (IAM Role) to use VPCE 
   - Update secret receipe bucket policy - Allow access to secret receipe bucket only from VPCE.
