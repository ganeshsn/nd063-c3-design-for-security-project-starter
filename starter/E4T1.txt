1) Place the Web Service instance to a private subnet (i.e. no route to internet via igw)
2) Delete SSH port inbound security rules of the Web Server;  use SSM to connect to the Web Server if needed.
3) Disable SSH password login on the web server instance

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

Create a VPC Gateway endpoint for S3, specify policy in VPCE to allow only priviledged users (IAM Role) to use VPCE and update the bucket policy to allow access only from VPCE.
