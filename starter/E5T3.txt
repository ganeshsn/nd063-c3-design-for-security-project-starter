I) To validate IaC CF templates, I used cfn_nag tool.

usage: cfn_nag_scan --input <CF yml file>

The scanner identified potential security vulnerabilites.

Security Groups found with ingress cidr that is not /32
Security Groups found with cidr open to world on ingress
Security Groups ingress with an ipProtocol of -1 found
IAM role should not allow * resource on its permissions policy
Fail: IAM role should not allow * action on its permissions policy
Elastic Load Balancer V2 Listener Protocol should use HTTPS for ALBs
Elastic Load Balancer V2 should have access logging enabled

S3 Bucket should have encryption option set
S3 Bucket should have access logging configured
S3 bucket should likely have a bucket policy

Fail: Missing egress rule means all traffic is allowed outbound.  Make this explicit if it is desired configuration


II)  Updated CF templates fixing security group and IAM issues and run the scanner.

   a) EC2 Instance role policy was updated to fix permissions policy that allows only GetObject on free receipe bucket.

    Policies:
        - PolicyName: InstanceRolePolicy-C3
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: 2012-10-17
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 's3:GetObject'
                Resource: !Join
                  - ''
                  - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'
                  - !Ref BucketNameRecipesFree
                  - /*

     b) WebAppSG security group was updated to fix Egress and Ingress rules as given below. 
        This ingress rule allows only TCP 5000 from ELB and Egress rule specify the destination as ELB 

     === 
    WebAppSG:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupName: WebAppSG
      GroupDescription: "Security group for this application server"
      SecurityGroupEgress:
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        CidrIp: AppLoadBalancerSG
      SecurityGroupIngress:
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        FromPort: 22
        ToPort: 22
        CidrIp: !Ref PublicSubnetTrusted
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        FromPort: 5000
        ToPort: 5000
        CidrIp: AppLoadBalancerSG
      VpcId: !ImportValue VpcId
